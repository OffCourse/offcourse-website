Imagine a world where everyone can learn anything and become who they want to be as a result. Offcourse is a platform for crowd sourced learning that is working to turn this vision into a reality.


## A Pinterest for Education

The world is changing and the possibilities of technology seem endless. Today, Facebook knows you better than your friends do. Amazon knows what you’ll by before you do. Yes, the world is changing, but changes in education are long overdue. Getting an education is becoming more and more expensive. If anything, current trends lead to more inequality, not less. But what if everybody could learn anything and become who they want to be? No matter how much money they have. No matter where they live. How many lives would this change?

We see a counter movement on the web: one where almost everything you want to learn, can be found online. But there’s still a problem here: it’s hard to know where to start learning and how to progress, especially when you’re new to a topic. This is where Offcourse comes in. We are building the tools that will help people browse, create and share collections of links to the web’s best learning resources. It’s like a Pinterest, but for education.


## Teach People to Learn

So how did I end up on SxSW, telling people about this mission to change the way we learn? It started when I was 20 and spent five weeks in the Dominican Republic (DR). Back in 2007, I traveled to Jarabacoa, a medium-sized town in the Dominican inlands. We painted houses, we painted schools, and we taught a few English classes. In return for our work, the boys we thaught took us swimming, horseback riding, and mountain climbing.

That summer, I saw the most beautiful waterfalls, danced the steamiest merengue and ate the best foods — from “tostones” (fried plantains) to the cheeks of a pig that was slaughtered especially for us. But during those five weeks, I started to realise more and more that the time that I spent in the DR was like eating that pig. An unforgettable experience, but unsettling at the same time. Again and again, I was confronted with the inequality that I had set out to fix, but couldn’t. I had travelled to the DR to make at least a tiny part of the world a better place. But what I learned was that most systems simply work because they exclude people. And that’s just wrong.

When we were about to return home, we still had money to spend. We heard about this guy who couldn’t go back to the school next year, because his family could no longer afford his tuition. He was the only one I knew of who was getting a professional degree. Most people I met there had little education past grade four. That was one of the reasons it was so easy for us to learn Spanish from them: the language they used was simple. We had a choice: to invest in this guy’s personal education or to buy more paint for the village. This was when I put my foot down. And I had the right: nobody had raised as much money as I had. And I had come to believe — and I still do — that the only right thing to do is to teach people to learn. Educate people and let people decide for themselves what they, their family or their community needs. They might not need paint at all, what did we know. This was why I wanted to invest in this guy and we did.


## The Course that Follows You

When I returned from the Dominican Republic, I considered getting a teaching degree. But something held me back. Friends of mine who were teachers left their jobs after a a few years. They told me not to do it. Schools are so bureaucratic, teachers often so traditional, they had chased my ambitious friends away. But more importantly, I didn’t want to teach people who were in schools already. Because why should we focus on schools when still only 7% of people will ever be in college? We need to start doing things differently and we need to do it together. Just think about it: do we really even need colleges and universities anymore? After all, diploma’s are just becoming pieces of paper that cost more and more and that are worth less and less in the job market. And isn’t it strange that we receive our diplomas from the same institutions that we just paid to teach us? I think it is. I think we’re living in an education bubble and excluding lots of people.

A few years ago I met a community of like minded people and we started Offcourse. Offcourse is a group of professors, students, content people like myself, developers and entrepreneurs who share one dream: to create new ways of teaching and learning. Because here’s the thing: today, we don’t need to bring people to schools anymore. We have the tools to bring the opportunity to learn to people everywhere. All you need is an internet connection. And there are so many connections that we can make that defy all boundaries, all hierarchies. Offcourse is a means to create communities around ever evolving hubs of knowledge. It is our mission to deliver community-driven education around the globe.

On Offcourse, you can browse collections that were made by others. You can create collections of your own to share the knowledge that you have with people around the world. You can also edit and update collections made by others. This way, the content on the platform keeps evolving and stays relevant and up to date for everyone. Finally, Offcourse will provide personal learning paths and continuous feedback on the progress that you make. All this activity can be gathered into a personal profile that you can show to a future employer. So Offcourse isn’t a course that you follow. It’s the course that follows you.
