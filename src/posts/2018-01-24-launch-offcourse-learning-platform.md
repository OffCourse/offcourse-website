We are finally here, as of last night the first public version of the Offcourse platform is **live!** An open source platform that facilitates what we call *crowdlearning*. What does this mean exactly and how can you use our platform, two questions we will answer to help you get started.


## Crowdlearning

We live in an age where we are constantly online. Technological developments present us with the opportunity to change how we do things. For Offcourse this was inspiration to modify our traditional learning styles and come up with a new way of learning. With Offcourse we are making education more accessible to a broader audience. We provide cheaper, more effective and more personal learning through our open source platform. We’re talking about an alternative learning environment to support people who do not have the chance to get a formal education or want to learn in a different way. We bring the opportunity to learn to people everywhere.

We call our platform a platform for crowdlearning, because we believe that if everybody shares what they know in one place, everybody can learn what they want. Whether someone wants to learn or knows a great many on how to code or any other topic. The platform is a community of people that are looking for lifelong learning opportunities. We are on our way to build a learning community around the globe through our platform where one can learn through the crowd.

*“If everybody shares what they know in one place, everybody can learn what they want.”*


## The platform — an open source learning platform

Offcourse is an online open source platform for crowdlearning. Thus, we stimulate our community members to learn, but also to share their knowledge to help others learn. Although the Offcourse platform can be used and applied to learn about all kinds of topics, the topic of development/ programming has our main focus for this moment.

Over the past year we have been working hard to define the main tools for the platform. Our tools will make sharing and learning within the community simple, effective, and fun. The tools allow you to pick, tweak and push hand-curated collections of links from the web’s best learning resources. These links are e.g. great tutorials, written guides or anything that helps you gain knowledge on a desired topic. Instead of spending hours creating content yourself, you pick the best online resources on a topic you love and put your collection together. Another feature of the platform is to tweak a collection of links made by someone else. This makes you get to add new knowledge to an existing topic. When your collection is ready you can push it on your social media channels or your website. Think of it as your Pinterest for learning.


We choose to work with an open source model because we encourage open collaboration. The current version of the platform is a **beta version**. This means we are still in an early stage of development and we continuously update and improve features to the platform. This is something **you can help us with** if you’re a developer. Read below how you can join us as a developer or in other ways we offer.


## Join us

There are three ways to join us. If you’re interested in improving your skills, you can sign up to our platform as a learner. No matter what field you’re in, we welcome everybody that has an interest in learning **21st-century skills**. You can also join us if you want to share your own knowledge with people on the platform. We then invite you to create content on the platform yourself. Thirdly, if you’re excited to help build our platform further, please have a look at the possibilities on the 'build' page on our website.

After sign up you can start creating your first card holding your learning goal for 2018. When you have defined what you want to learn you can start picking, tweaking and sharing links to the best online sources. Or start creating your own content and share it with your network to show your skills.
