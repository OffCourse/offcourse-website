Knowledge management is an important topic for organisations with respect to innovation and often, too, with respect to reducing operational costs. Tools for creating and sharing knowledge are needed to achieve this. The Offcourse platform has potential as knowledge management system for organisations because of its knowledge sharing capabilities. A pilot project together with Waag -a knowledge institute - runs to extract and distribute Waag's internal knowledge to its students with use of the tools of the Offcourse platform.

## Knowledge management does not equal information management

The challenge with knowledge management is that knowledge is often tacit- it involves people's thinking, rather than they are numbers and facts like with information. Tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer, but becomes only valuable when available. This is relevant for knowledge institutions more specifically, as knowledge is what they produce.

Because of the tacit character of knowledge, organisations want to capture the tacit knowledge of their employees before they leave or retire. This requires knowledge to be captured and shared in a central place to overcome re-work because of the person that holds the specific knowledge is no longer working at the company. Re-work increases the operational costs within the business. Second, it increases the innovation rate of the company when knowledge is well captured and shared, because it allows for further development of that knowledge. Sharing knowledge with the outside world, can also bring new opportunities for innovating with partners.

## Potential value of knowledge management

Openness and transparency is what customers and partners expect from organisations. In addition to being a prerequisite for doing business, knowledge management has important value to organisations, both internal and external:

- Knowledge sharing enables interaction which helps building a community (internal and external)
- Supporting knowledge development helps creating a learning environment within the company
- Knowledge sharing create exposure to your target audience as authority
- Sharing knowledge attracts potential new target groups
- Opening up by sharing knowledge offers opportunities for partnerships in innovation

Offcourse helps knowledge heavy organisations with their knowledge management. Our mission is to help people grow as professionals. An organization that is also concerned with this is Waag. Offcourse and Waag run a project together to use the potential of all the knowledge that is generated within the organization to its fullest.

## Case study Waag, Amsterdam

Waag is a Knowledge Institute based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The institute operates at the intersection of science, technology and the arts, focusing on technology as an instrument of social change. Their organisation, of about 60 people, is built up into two divisions: a research division to gather new knowledge on the topic of science, technology and arts, and an operational division that is focused on using their knowledge through e.g. courses and workshops they give.

Due to the absence of a fitting ecosystem for knowledge management for the employees working at the Amsterdam office, knowledge generated and collected by Waag has become fragmented throughout the organisation. Waag sees a lot of potential in not only documenting that knowledge in one central place, but also to share it within and outside the organization. Different tools and systems have been tested at Waag to find the right solution. So far none of these tool fit the need for a creative solution to translate knowledge into manageable material.

Offcourse offers an online learning environment where knowledge can be brought out in a structured, stable and sustainable way. This is why Waag and Offcourse decided to partner up and see how the Offcourse platform can help Waag with their ambitions. Together they work on mapping Waag's knowledge and practices for knowledge management. To see how their knowledge can be translated into shareable bits and pieces, Offcourse helps Waag by creating content on the Offcourse platform. A next step will be to test the usage of the platform among Waag's employees in Amsterdam in order to collects insights regarding the potential of the Offcourse platform for Waag in the future.

## Knowledge management systems offer a place to store, share and grow knowledge

The most important required characteristic of a knowledge system is that it should be sustainable. This means the system needs more than just storing capabilities. With storing only, knowledge can not be updated, therefore not be managed. Users of the system should be able to change and share the content of the system in order for the knowledge to grow.

Offcourse works together with knowledge institutions to facilitate knowledge development and knowledge sharing. Institutions contribute to the further development of the platform and Offcourse offers institutions services such as building an integration with the organisation's intranet, creating an organisation's personal environment within the platform or creating content on the platform holding the organisation's relevant knowledge.
