Offcourse is collaborating with Peter Troxler, Research Professor in "Revolution of Manufacturing" at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Peter is not just a respected academic in his field but a pioneer of Maker Education in the Netherlands. However, before diving into the aspects of collaboration and the goals for this project, here are some things that you need to know about the Maker Movement.


## What is the Maker Movement and Makerspaces?

The Maker Movement is defined by Adweek as [" the umbrella term for independent inventors, designers, and tinkerers."](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/which-big-brands-are-courting-maker-movement-and-why-156315/) The movement takes on various shapes and forms depending on focus of expertise. Makerspaces are therefore, the hubs, facilities and workshops that help flourish the Maker Movement. That being said, what exactly are "*makerspaces"*?

Makerspaces are collaborating co-working environments/facilities that are used to learn , explore, share and create new innovations using either high tech and non-tech tools. The spaces have also been dubbed the "*Do-It-Yourself* schools" as these spaces help prepare those looking to hone their 21st century skills in sectors of technology, science, engineering, design and math.

The maker-movement has no exact beginning. Some argue our school sciences fairs, arts and crafts and education facilities have been exporting the same maker-movement ideals for many years. However, the coined-term "makerspaces" become fully associated with tech jargon after the creation of the well-known magazine "Make" in the year 2005.  The magazine put a spotlight on projects, facilities and workshops championing the maker-mindset. This encouraged the advent of the maker movement to greater lengths. For example, the establishment of Fablabs, which are small-scale workshops offering access to modern means of digital fabrications. In addition, there is the creation of intersectional organizations such as *Waag* in the Netherlands, who not only promote maker-projects but act as mediums between the fields of sciences, technology and the arts in the 21st century.


## The Maker Movement and Offcourse

The Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences is one of many universities in the Netherlands (such as Eindhoven University of Technology) that have taken the steps to include the makerspaces into the schools active pedagogy and curriculum.

This practical way of integration is adapting further in view of learning. [Offcourse.io](http://offcourse.io) is one of the platforms that aims to become an open-source collective in creating and sharing knowledge to the larger public. It supports learning in your own preferred way. In addition, the Fablab experts want to provide a much less rigid curricular to individuals who wish to polish or expand their skill set. Class is not limited to lectures or short activities but rather practical and realistic simulations that complement your learning abilities. This is where learners can put their theory into practice, which is the overall aim of the joint venture between Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences and Offcourse.
