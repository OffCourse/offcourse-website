As you know, Offcourse is an open source foundation and is currently in the works to develop and become more sustainable. For those that may not know what open source is : this is where any original source code, development, or infrastructure is open to public use; therefore open to further distribution and modification. This blog will go through Offcourse's recent venture in becoming a collective under the Open Collective platform. Find out the reasons why we are becoming a collective, what it entails and what to look forward to in the coming months!

## What is Open Collective?

[Open Collective](www.opencollective.com/) is an organization formed in the US, that provides a platform which makes collecting and sharing funds easier. It runs on similar aspects like that of sites such as [GoFundMe](www.gofundme.com/) , [YouCaring](www.youcaring.com/) and [Fundly](www.fundly.com/), but brings a refreshing aspect to accountability and handling funds. The platform is open source in design, development and funding. Furthermore, sponsors get to approve expenses and also have an overview of how the funding is used.

The framework of funding works around three main characters: the organisation- who is in search of support-, backers -who are individuals who subscribe to donate to various organisations monthly- and sponsors who make one-time or multiple donations.

## Why are we becoming an Open Collective?

Become a collective has become one of the practical ways of supporting upcoming foundations, associations and start-ups. A few good examples of some intriguing organisations that have signed up on the Open Collective platform are [Hoodie](www.opencollective.com/hoodie), [Socialcoop](www.opencollective.com/socialcoop), [Brussels Together](www.opencollective.com/brusselstogether) and [Women Who Code Camp](www.opencollective.com/wwcode).

Offcourse started as a side project called Coding the Humanities, but since 2016 we function as a not-for-profit association. For the past year or so, Jan Hein (Founder and Developer), and his team have been running and developing the Offcourse platform that was launched in January of this year. With the help from funds like CityLab010 in Rotterdam, and private investments by generous donors we have been able to develop a first working version of our online learning platform and offer interesting learning material.
The Offcourse team grew little by little and now features 13 professionals, volunteers, student interns and freelancers who contribute to its further deployment and growth. Our dream is to grow bigger and make Offcourse a sustainable organization. To get there we need your contribution! We are open source and open content, hence we believe in organic growth with the help of like-minded individuals. We would like to expand the functionalities of our platform organize events for our learning community, and keep and expand [our team of professionals](https://www.offcourse.io/join) to make it happen.

## What to look forward to as part of the Offcourse Community?

Offcourse is in the works of launching a series of meet-ups here in Rotterdam, under the theme of Wicked Problems- be on the look out for more info about this series!. Therefore we will also expand our community related activities but also grow our team of contributors that help further develop the Offcourse platform and community. The series of meetups will be the occasion for our Offcourse contributors to network, discuss and put in practice your talents alongside like-minded individuals.
